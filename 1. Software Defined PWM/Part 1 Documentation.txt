This code is written for MSP430 microcontroller using Code Composer Studio (CCS) IDE. 
It initializes the on-board LEDs and buttons, and sets up a timer to control the LEDs' 
on and off timing using pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals.

The LEDSetup() function sets the P1.0 and P6.6 pins as outputs and clears their output latches.

The ButtonSetup() function sets the P2.3 and P4.1 pins as inputs and enables their pull-up resistors. 
It also sets their interrupt edges and enables their interrupts.

The TimerB0Setup() function configures Timer B0 to use SMCLK as the clock source, 
sets the timer mode to up mode, clears the timer register, enables its interrupt, 
and sets the output modes of the CCR0, CCR1, and CCR2 registers to toggle/set/reset respectively. 
It also sets the initial values of CCR0, CCR1, and CCR2 registers.

The Port_2() and Port_4() interrupt service routines are triggered by button presses on P2.3 and P4.1 respectively.
 They check the current values of CCR1 and CCR2, and increment them by 100 if they are less than 1000.

The Timer0_B1_ISR() interrupt service routine is triggered by Timer B0 interrupts. 
It checks the interrupt flag register of Timer B0 and toggles the state of P1.0 and P6.6 LEDs by setting or clearing 
them based on the output modes set in the TimerB0Setup() function.

Overall, this code implements a simple LED control system using PWM and button inputs.
